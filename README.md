# Amazon-Clone
This project is a basic replica of the Amazon website made using only HTML and CSS. It includes:

A top navigation bar with a logo, search bar, and links for sign-in and the cart.
A homepage layout to display products and categories in a clean grid or slider style.
A footer with links and extra information.
The project focuses on creating a good-looking and functional design without using JavaScript or any backend tools. Itâ€™s a simple way to practice HTML and CSS skills.
